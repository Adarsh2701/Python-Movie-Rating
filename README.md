## Introduction

The Python Movie Rating Analysis project explores and visualizes movie rating data to derive meaningful insights. By leveraging Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, the project aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of movie ratings.

## Project Overview

This project uses a dataset named `movies.csv` to perform various analyses on movie ratings. The analysis includes:

- Distribution of ratings across different movies.
- Trends and patterns in rating scores.
- Visualizations to represent rating distributions and correlations.

## Data Description

The dataset used in this project is `movies.csv`. It contains information on movies and their ratings, with the following columns:

- `movie_id`: Unique identifier for each movie.
- `title`: Title of the movie.
- `rating`: Rating given to the movie.
- `release_year`: Year the movie was released.
- `genre`: Genre of the movie.

## Analysis

The analysis includes the following steps:

1. **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values and formatting data.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Using Pandas to explore data and identify key trends.
3. **Visualization**: Employing Matplotlib and Seaborn to create visual representations of rating distributions and correlations.
4. **Insights**: Deriving actionable insights from the visualizations and statistical analysis.

## Results

The analysis provides insights into:

- The distribution of ratings across different genres.
- Trends in ratings over the years.
- Correlations between rating scores and movie attributes.

## Usage
